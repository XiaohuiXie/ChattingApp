  Steps to run flask server example:

1) Install MySQL, PyCharm
2) In mysql you need to create a simple table with two columns: name & email.
3) In Pycharm or terminal window need to install following packages:
Pip
Flask
mysql-client
flask-mysqldb
JSON
(packages can be installed via file settings-> interepter and hit the plus sign, or can be done in command line. 
To install flask will need to use pip)
4) In the code that says app.config['MySQL_Host'] it should equal localhost unless you are connecting elsewhere(then put ip address). 
The user & password should be the one you set up when installing mysql. The mysql_db should be the name of the databse you made or 
are connecting to.

5) Once packages are installed you should then be able to run the app.
Once running the code, you can open an browser and go to lcoalhost. At the bottom of the code it will show the url.
